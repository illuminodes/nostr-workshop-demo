# Nostr workshop demo
Basic demonstration of a Nostr web-socket client embedded in the browser, with links and resources.

Demostrates how to create basic FHIR data objects, serialize them into Nostr Notes, and sign and send them to the Nostr network.

Also demonstrates how Nostr Notes can be verified without the need of trusted third parties.

original tutorial this is based off of.
